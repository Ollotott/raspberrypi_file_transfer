# raspberrypi_file_transfer
I created this program to run on a raspberry pi in order to transport files from an SD card to a connected SSD. (Couldn't access phone/laptop, needed more storage on camera). The pi should be connected to one of those small 16*2 character LCD screens, a rotary encoder and a button. I programmed it to be modular, so that new scripts could be imported from a connected drive, or the main scripts could be updated using a connected drive called "update".
